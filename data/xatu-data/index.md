# Xatu Data

## Overview

This data collection provides comprehensive statistics on the Ethereum network performance for 2024. The information presented here is gathered through ethPandaOps monitoring infrastructure.

## Key Metrics

### Validator Statistics

- **Total Validators**: 889,450
- **Average Effectiveness**: 99.2%
- **Average Balance**: 33.42 ETH
- **New Validators (2024)**: 57,320

### Network Performance

- **Average Block Time**: 12.03 seconds
- **Average Gas Used Per Block**: 15.2M
- **Average Daily Transactions**: 1.2M
- **Peak TPS**: 42.5

### Client Adoption

The following statistics represent the estimated distribution of consensus clients on the network:

| Client      | January 2024 | June 2024 | Change |
|-------------|--------------|-----------|--------|
| Lighthouse  | 40%          | 42%       | +2%    |
| Prysm       | 35%          | 32%       | -3%    |
| Teku        | 15%          | 16%       | +1%    |
| Nimbus      | 8%           | 10%       | +2%    |
| Others      | 2%           | 0%        | -2%    |

## Analysis

The first half of 2024 has shown continued stability in the Ethereum network following the Dencun upgrade. We observe:

1. Steady growth in validator count
2. Improved client diversity with gains for Lighthouse and Nimbus
3. Consistent block production time of ~12 seconds
4. Stable transaction throughput
