Spamoor is a sophisticated transaction generator for Ethereum testnets, designed to simulate network load and test transaction processing under various conditions.

## What is Spamoor?

Spamoor helps developers and researchers generate controlled transaction loads on Ethereum networks. This tool is invaluable for testing network performance, transaction processing capabilities, and client behavior under different load conditions. By generating randomized or patterned transactions, Spamoor enables thorough network stress testing and performance analysis.

## Key Features

- **Configurable Transaction Generation**: Control rate, size, and type of transactions
- **Multiple Transaction Types**: Generate standard transfers, contract deployments, or contract interactions
- **Rate Limiting**: Precisely control the number of transactions per second
- **Gas Price Strategies**: Various strategies for setting gas prices and priority fees
- **Account Management**: Automatically manage multiple sender accounts
- **Randomization Options**: Generate transactions with random or patterned data
- **Network Targeting**: Direct transactions to specific nodes or broadcast to the network
- **Metrics and Reporting**: Track transaction confirmation times and success rates

## Transaction Strategies

Spamoor supports various transaction generation strategies:

### Recipient Strategies

- **Fixed**: Send to a specific address
- **Random**: Generate random recipient addresses
- **Sequential**: Use a sequence of pre-defined addresses

### Value Strategies

- **Fixed**: Use the same value for all transactions
- **Random**: Random values within a specified range
- **Incremental**: Start with a base value and increment by a step

### Gas Price Strategies

- **Fixed**: Use a constant gas price
- **Base Fee Multiplier**: Calculate based on the current base fee
- **Dynamic**: Adjust based on network conditions

## Integration with Other Tools

Spamoor works well with other ethPandaOps tools:

- **Assertoor**: Validate network behavior under load generated by Spamoor
- **Kurtosis**: Use Spamoor within Kurtosis environments for controlled testing
- **Mempool-bridge**: Test mempool bridge behavior with controlled transaction loads

## Use Cases

- **Network Stress Testing**: Evaluate network performance under high transaction load
- **Client Testing**: Compare how different clients handle transaction spikes
- **MEV Research**: Study MEV extraction opportunities with controlled transactions
- **Protocol Upgrades**: Test protocol changes under realistic network conditions
- **Gas Market Analysis**: Analyze gas price dynamics under various transaction patterns
