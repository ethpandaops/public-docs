Forky is an Ethereum beacon chain fork choice visualizer that helps operators and developers understand the state of the beacon chain's fork choice algorithm in real-time.

## What is Forky?

Forky provides a visual representation of the Ethereum beacon chain's fork choice, which is the algorithm that determines which chain of blocks the network follows. This visualization makes it easier to identify and understand forks, reorganizations, and other consensus-related events on the Ethereum network.

## Key Features

- **Real-time visualization**: Watch the beacon chain fork choice update in real-time
- **Fork detection**: Clearly see when and where forks occur in the network
- **Block details**: View detailed information about individual blocks
- **Validator insights**: See which validators proposed specific blocks
- **Historical replay**: Review past fork choice events to understand network behavior

## Interpreting the Visualization

- **Blocks**: Represented as boxes in the visualization
- **Connections**: Lines showing the parent-child relationships between blocks
- **Colors**: Different colors indicate block status (canonical, orphaned, etc.)
- **Validators**: Information about which validator proposed each block

## Use Cases

- **Network Monitoring**: Track the health and stability of the beacon chain
- **Debug Consensus Issues**: Identify and diagnose problems in the fork choice
- **Educational Tool**: Learn how Ethereum's consensus mechanisms work
- **Research**: Analyze fork choice behavior under different network conditions
