# Tracoor

Tracoor is a specialized tool for displaying and tracking invalid slots and blocks in the Ethereum network, helping developers and operators debug consensus issues.

## What is Tracoor?

Tracoor serves as a dedicated tool for monitoring and displaying invalid slots and blocks on the Ethereum beacon chain. By collecting and visualizing this information, it provides valuable insights for debugging consensus issues, understanding network anomalies, and improving overall network reliability.

## Key Features

- **Invalid Block Tracking**: Identify and monitor invalid blocks across the network
- **Invalid Slot Detection**: Track slots where block production failed or was suboptimal
- **Visualization**: Clear visual representation of network irregularities
- **Historical Data**: Access to historical invalid block and slot information
- **Filtering and Sorting**: Easily find specific types of invalid blocks or slots
- **API Access**: Programmatically access invalid block and slot data

## Use Cases

- **Network Debugging**: Identify and resolve consensus issues
- **Protocol Analysis**: Study patterns of invalid blocks to improve protocol design
- **Client Testing**: Compare different client implementations' handling of edge cases
- **Network Monitoring**: Track network health through invalid block metrics
