# Intro

The [Xatu Stack](/docs/guides/data-analysts/xatu-stack) is our primary data pipeline tool that enables collection, processing, and analysis of Ethereum network data. It provides powerful capabilities for data analysts to:

- Capture network events in real-time
- Store historical data for trend analysis
- Create custom queries and aggregations
- Build sophisticated dashboards

## Getting Started

If you're a data analyst looking to work with Ethereum data, we recommend:

1. Exploring the [Xatu architecture](/docs/guides/data-analysts/xatu-stack/components) to understand the data pipeline
2. Learning how to [query data with Clickhouse](/docs/guides/data-analysts/xatu-stack/clickhouse/example-queries)
3. Setting up your own [Xatu deployment](/docs/guides/data-analysts/xatu-stack) for data collection 

## Overview

Xatu is a powerful data collection and analysis platform for Ethereum networks. These guides will help you set up various Xatu components and start collecting valuable network data.
